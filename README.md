## üöÄ About
<p align="justify">
This is a simple Discord bot written in Python that provides real-time weather information using WeatherAPI.com. The bot allows users to request weather data for any location‚Äîincluding current conditions, forecasts, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more‚Äîand integrates seamlessly with Discord to enable interaction via text commands. Weather details are fetched from WeatherAPI.com and delivered in an easy-to-read format.

This project is my first major undertaking using Python. Through its development, I learned how API connections work, how to process and utilize received data, and how to handle JSON responses. Additionally, I gained valuable experience working with external libraries, structuring a Python project, creating GitHub repositories, and writing effective README documentation.
